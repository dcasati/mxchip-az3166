# Getting Started with Azure RTOS

This Getting Started guide is a series of tutorials that shows device developers how to start working with Azure RTOS. Each tutorial in the series follows the same pattern in which you take a micro-controller unit (MCU), flash the MCU with Azure RTOS sample code and configuration settings, and connect to Azure IoT.

Refer to [Getting Started with Azure RTOS](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2129824) for additional information on the guides and Azure RTOS.

## Getting Started Guides

The following board specific guides will get you started with Azure RTOS:

> * Getting started with the Microchip [ATSAME54-XPRO](Microchip/ATSAME54-XPRO)
> * Getting started with the NXP [MIMXRT1060-EVK](NXP/MIMXRT1060-EVK)
> * Getting started with the Renesas [Synergy Platform](Renesas/Synergy)
> * Getting started with the STMicroelectronics [B-475E-IOT01](STMicroelectronics/B-L475E-IOT01A)

Once you have successfully completed a guide, please read [Using Azure RTOS in the Getting Started Guides](/docs/using-azure-rtos.md) for information on how the guides use Azure RTOS to connect with Azure IoT.
