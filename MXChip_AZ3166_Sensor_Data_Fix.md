# MXChip AZ3166 Sensor Data Fix Summary

## Issue
MQTT messages were being published with empty sensor values:
```
Topic: mxchip/telemetry
Message: {"temperature": }
Message: {"pressure": }
Message: {"humidity": }
Message: {"acceleration": }
Message: {"magnetic": }
```

## Root Cause
The sensor reading functions had a critical bug with static timeout variables:
- All sensors used `static uint32_t timeout = 5;`
- Once the timeout reached 0, it stayed 0 forever due to being static
- After the first few sensor reads, the timeout would be 0 and sensors would return uninitialized data
- This caused `%.2f` format specifiers to fail and produce empty JSON values

## Files Fixed

### 1. Pressure/Temperature Sensor (LPS22HB)
**File:** `MXChip/AZ3166/lib/mxchip_bsp/stm_sensor/Src/lps22hb_read_data_polling.c`

**Before:**
```c
static uint32_t timeout = 5;
lps22hb_t lps22hb_data_read(void) {
    lps22hb_t reading = {0};
    uint8_t reg;
    while((reg!=1) && (timeout>0)) {
        lps22hb_press_data_ready_get(&dev_ctx, &reg);
        timeout--;
    }
    // ... rest of function
}
```

**After:**
```c
lps22hb_t lps22hb_data_read(void) {
    lps22hb_t reading = {0};
    uint8_t reg = 0;
    uint32_t timeout = 5000; // Reset timeout for each read, increase timeout value
    while((reg!=1) && (timeout>0)) {
        lps22hb_press_data_ready_get(&dev_ctx, &reg);
        timeout--;
    }
    // ... rest of function
}
```

### 2. Humidity/Temperature Sensor (HTS221)
**File:** `MXChip/AZ3166/lib/mxchip_bsp/stm_sensor/Src/hts221_read_data_polling.c`

**Changes:**
- Removed `static uint32_t timeout = 5;`
- Added local `uint32_t timeout = 5000;` in `hts221_data_read()` function

### 3. Accelerometer/Gyroscope Sensor (LSM6DSL)
**File:** `MXChip/AZ3166/lib/mxchip_bsp/stm_sensor/Src/lsm6dsl_read_data_polling.c`

**Changes:**
- Removed `static uint32_t timeout = 5;`
- Added local `uint32_t timeout = 5000;` in `lsm6dsl_data_read()` function

### 4. Magnetometer Sensor (LIS2MDL)
**File:** `MXChip/AZ3166/lib/mxchip_bsp/stm_sensor/Src/lis2mdl_read_data_polling.c`

**Changes:**
- Removed `static uint32_t timeout = 5;`
- Removed `timeout = 5;` reset in config function
- Added local `uint32_t timeout = 5000;` in `lis2mdl_data_read()` function
- Initialized `reg = 0` to avoid using uninitialized variable

## Improvements Made

1. **Fixed Static Timeout Bug**: Changed from static to local timeout variables that reset on each sensor read
2. **Increased Timeout Value**: Changed from 5 to 5000 iterations for more reliable sensor readings
3. **Initialized Variables**: Properly initialized `reg` variables to avoid undefined behavior
4. **Consistent Pattern**: Applied the same fix pattern across all sensor drivers

## Expected Result
After the fix, you should see valid sensor data in MQTT messages:
```
Topic: mxchip/telemetry
Message: {"temperature": 23.45}
Publishing temperature: 23.45Â°C
Message: {"pressure": 1013.25}
Message: {"humidity": 45.67}
Message: {"acceleration": [0.12, -0.45, 9.81]}
Message: {"magnetic": [0.23, -0.15, 0.42]}
```

## Technical Details
- **Timeout Purpose**: Waits for sensor data ready flags before reading values
- **Why Static Was Bad**: Static variables retain their value between function calls
- **Why 5000**: Provides sufficient time for sensors to have data ready while preventing infinite loops
- **Variable Initialization**: Ensures variables start with known values to avoid undefined behavior

The fix ensures that each sensor reading operation has a fresh timeout counter and properly waits for sensor data to be ready before reading, resulting in valid sensor values being published to MQTT.
